# GraphTheoryProject
Author: Cormac Raftery

This is a project given to me by Ian McLoughlin during my 3rd year of Software Development for a subject called Graph Theory.

The goal of the project is to: write a program in the Python programming language that can
build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given
string of text. 

All of the code used in this project is either taken from the coding videos provided by the lecturer or is my own code. 

# Research

This project required a lot of research as I have not much experience coding in python prior to this project.
I have watched all the videos provided by the lecture to teach me the basics and I have also looked at some students projects from last year which were written in the GO programming language. 
This was mostly for inspiration on how to improve the project and to help avoid errors that they might have encountered.
